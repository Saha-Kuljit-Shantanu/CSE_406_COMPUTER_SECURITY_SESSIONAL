By the following regular expression matching rule, we can manually track the malware to estimate whether it can take input from a program and give output to console : \\

\begin{yaracode}

//Matching with regular expressions

rule test_SCAN_PRINT { 

    meta : 

        description = "Let's see if the file has scanning and printing properties"
        author = "Saha Kuljit Shantanu"
        date = "05-03-2024"

    strings :

        
        $scan = /[a-z]{0,}scanf[a-z]{0,}/   
        $print = /[a-z]{0,}printf[a-z]{0,}/
        $get = /[a-z]{0,}get[a-z]{0,}/   
        $put = /[a-z]{0,}put[a-z]{0,}/

    
    condition: 

        $scan or $print or $get or $put
    
    
}
