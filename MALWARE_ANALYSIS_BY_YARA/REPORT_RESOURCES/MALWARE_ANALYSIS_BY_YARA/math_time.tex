The math module includes the following functions:

\begin{itemize}


    \item \textbf{entropy: } entropy is the measure of how random all the bytes are with respect to each other in a file. The actions of a malware with a large entropy is really hard to predict as different bytes are placed at random positions. On the other hand, actions of a malware with lesser entropy is easier to predict. In fact, it is comparatively easy to estimate the contents of a malware with lower entropy. A malware with entropy higher than 7 is considered to be a strong malware and a malware with entropy less than 7 is considered to be a weak malware.

    The entropy of libxselinux.so is \textbf{4.764744}. Hence this malware is weak.

    \item \textbf{mode: } mode method returns the byte that is present in a file maximum number of times. The mode byte of libxselinux.so is 00

    \item \textbf{percentage: } percentage of a byte is the ratio of the number of that byte within the content to the number of byte in the constant times 100. The percentage of the mode byte(00) in libxselinux.so is 43%

    
\end{itemize}
The time module includes a \textbf{now} function that prints the point in current timestamp in seconds.
