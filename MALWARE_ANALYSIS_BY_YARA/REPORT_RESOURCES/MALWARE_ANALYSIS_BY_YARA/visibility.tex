By the following rule, we can detect if the malware is susceptible to hide its existence : \\

\begin{yaracode}

//Matching malware invisibility

rule is_SELF_INVISIBLE {

    meta : 

        description = "Let's see if the malware is hiding itself"
        author = "Saha Kuljit Shantanu"
        date = "05-03-2024"

    strings :

        $eax = "_invisible" nocase

    condition:

        $eax


}
