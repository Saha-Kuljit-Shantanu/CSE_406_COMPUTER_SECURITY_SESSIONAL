The malware we were supplied for analysis by YARA tool was "libxselinux.so" which is a library file that has powerful properties to make system calls when any other c program includes it and executes itself.\\
\\
Executing the malware in local machine is a risk factor, hence it is not feasible to execute the file. However, the malware can be opened in hexadecimal format and assembly format.\\
\\
We can open the malware "libxselinux.so" into some file "libxselinux.txt" in hexadecimal format through the following command:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor= shellbackground, formatcom= \color{shelltext}]{bash}

    $ xxd libxselinux.so > libxselinux.txt
    
\end{minted}
We can open the malware "libxselinux.so" into some file "libxselinux.asm" in x86 assembly encoding format through the following command:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor= shellbackground, formatcom= \color{shelltext}]{bash}

    $ objdump -d -S libxselinux.so > libxselinux.asm
    
\end{minted}
